# The source code for project for the PhD level course on Reinforcement Learning

This is a self-contained repository for source codes for the project for [the PhD level course on Reinforcement Learning given by Farnaz Adib Yaghmaie at the automatic control devision , ISY, Linköping University.](https://farad59.gitlab-pages.liu.se/reinforcement_learning_phd_course/)

## Project 1: Implementing basic tabular approaches on Blackjack
In the first project, we implement a couple of basic tabular algorithms from the following _book_

R. Sutton and A. Barto, [“Reinforcement learning: An introduction”](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html), MIT press, 2018.

 on [the Blackjack environment provided by OpenAI Gymnasium.](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/blackjack/) Complete the code by replacing ``None`` with code in the blocks denoted by ``start your code here`` and ``end your code here``.

*  Q-leaning algorithm on page 131 of the book. 
* sarsa algorithm on page 130 of the book. 
* expected sarsa on page 133 of the book. 
* Double Q-learning on page 136 of the book. 
* on-policy first-visit MC control on page 101 of the book. 

### Running on local computer
* Go to [https://github.com/FarnazAdib/projects_for_RL_course.git] and clone the project.
* Open PyCharm. From PyCharm. Click File and open project. Then, navigate to the project folder.
* Build a virtual environment and import required libraries.
